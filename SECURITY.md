# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately to the maintainers (see MAINTAINERS.md). We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and work on a fix.

Do not create public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

## Secrets and Placeholders
- Replace placeholders like `<REDACTED>` with your own values locally.
- Kerberos examples intentionally use the `EXAMPLE.COM` realm. Replace it with your own realm when adapting the configuration.
